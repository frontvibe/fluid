Fluid is a Hydrogen theme that let's you easily build Shopify headless storefronts by organizing your content with the Sanity CMS. Build your pages by assembling sections like you would do in a Shopify Liquid theme.

Using Sanity [Visual Editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qheADLqhBs), content editors can update content in real-time and live preview.

Take a look at the demo [here](https://fluid-demo.frontvibe.com/).
